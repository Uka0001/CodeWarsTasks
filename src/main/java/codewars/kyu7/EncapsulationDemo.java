/*DESCRIPTION:
In Java, we have a very powerful library named Lombok.
 It helps to reduce the boilerplate code.
This Kata is a challenge created for you to learn how to use lombok.
Giving the following class:
public class EncapsulationDemo{
  public int number;
  public String stringValue;
  public Object anObject;
}
We have to do the following modifications to properly encapsulate info:
make fields private
provide accessors to the internal fields ( setters/getters )
provide an empty constructor to support Java Beans specification
Add a constructor that can receive parameters for all of the fields
Note: make sure if you don't use Lombok to enforce proper naming conventions.
If you want a harder version please try: Lombok Encapsulation II*/

public class EncapsulationDemo {
    private int number;
    private String stringValue;
    private Object anObject;
}
